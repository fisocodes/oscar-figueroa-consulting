## Technology stack

#### Environemt
**Node** Widely used for building high-performance applications, especially those that require real-time interaction or handle a lot of concurrent requests.

#### Framework
**Next.JS** Packs a rich set of features that make it highly flexible and efficient for building React applications.

#### Styling
**TailwindCSS** Is a utility-first CSS framework that takes a different approach: instead of writing custom CSS classes for your design, you compose your UI directly in your markup using pre-defined utility classes.

#### CI/CD
**GitHub Actions** Stands out as a powerful, flexible, and fully integrated platform for automating your development lifecycleâ€”from code commits to production deployments.

#### Git
**Husky** Is a tool that simplifies managing Git hooks in your project. It automates the installation and configuration of hooks ensuring that code quality checks run automatically during your Git workflow.

#### Formatting
**TS-Standard** Is an opinionated linter and formatter tailored for TypeScript projects. It provides a zero-configuration setup that enforces a consistent code style and catches common errors.

#### Internationalization
**Next-Intl** Is a library designed specifically for managing internationalization (i18n) in Next.js applications. It offers a well-integrated, type-safe solution that leverages modern Next.js features such as the App Router and Server Components.

#### Testing
**Cypress** Is a powerful end-to-end testing framework designed for web applications. It runs directly in the browser. Its developer-friendly API and quick setup make it a popular choice for creating robust, maintainable tests that simulate real user interactions.
